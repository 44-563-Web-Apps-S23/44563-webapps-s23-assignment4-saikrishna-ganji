            SCENE: _A drawing-room. Entrance_, C; _sofa, chairs, writing-desk._
            JACQUES _and_ HENRIETTE _enter_ C, _from dinner_. HENRIETTE _in
            ball costume_, JACQUES _in evening dress. They come down_ C.

            HENRIETTE. What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?

            JACQUES. You can easily guess.

            HENRIETTE. You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.

            JACQUES. I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
            am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?

            HENRIETTE. Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
            good friends! And now you're going to be angry.

            JACQUES. Why?

            HENRIETTE. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd
            like.

            JACQUES. You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?

            HENRIETTE. Frankly, no.

            JACQUES. I don't please you?

            HENRIETTE. As a cousin you are charming; as a husband you would be quite
            impossible.

            JACQUES. What have you against me?

            HENRIETTE. Nothing that you're to blame for. It is merely the fault of
            my character; _that_ forces me to refuse you.

            JACQUES. But I can't see why you----?
