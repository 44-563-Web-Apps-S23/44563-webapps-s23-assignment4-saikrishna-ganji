        <h5>MODESTY Paul Hervieu</h5> 

        <p>
            SCENE: _A drawing-room. Entrance_, C; _sofa, chairs, writing-desk._
            JACQUES _and_ HENRIETTE _enter_ C, _from dinner_. HENRIETTE _in
            ball costume_, JACQUES _in evening dress. They come down_ C.</p>

        <p>HENRIETTE. What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?</p>

        <p>JACQUES. You can easily guess.</p>   

        <p>HENRIETTE. You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.</p>

        <p>JACQUES. I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
            am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?</p>

        <p>HENRIETTE. Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
            good friends! And now you're going to be angry.</p>

        <p>JACQUES. Why?</p>

        <p>HENRIETTE. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd
            like.</p>

        <p>JACQUES. You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?</p>
